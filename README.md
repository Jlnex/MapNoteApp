# 📝 About the Project
The MapNoteApp is a practical and responsive web application designed to allow users to save notes tied to specific geographic locations.

This project was built entirely using Vanilla JavaScript, focusing heavily on Third-Party API Integration (for mapping) and client-side data persistence. It serves as a strong demonstration of integrating geographical data with custom user input logic.

# ✨ Key Features
Real-time Map Integration: Utilizes the Leaflet.js mapping library (or similar) to display interactive maps and tiles.

Geolocation Tracking: Automatically centers the map on the user's current position upon loading using the browser's Geolocation API.

Location-Based Note Creation: Users can click anywhere on the map to drop a marker, then input a custom note (e.g., a meeting, a memorable spot, or a task).

Data Persistence: All created notes and their coordinates are saved using Local Storage, ensuring the data remains available even after the user closes and reopens the application.

Dynamic Marker Display: Saved notes are automatically loaded from Local Storage and displayed as interactive markers on the map.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure.

CSS3: Styling and layout.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): Core logic, API integration, DOM manipulation, and data handling.
